# James Romo Freelancer Page

Simple Bootstrap project I created using the Freelancer portfolio theme to showcase my projects.

## Creator

[Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) is a one page freelancer portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects, full page portfolio item modals, and a working PHP contact form.

Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by **David Miller**, Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](http://www.ironsummitmedia.com/).
